using signature change:
make all members and methods/functions CamelCase
make all locals _pascalCase
make all arguements/parameters pascalCase

organise contents of headers by
// Constructors and Destructors
// Members
// Methods
// Type Methods
// other scoped methods
// Wrapped Functions
// Virtual Pure Methods
// Virtual 
// Inherited via (Capitalised class)
UNDER the access specifier
and no indentations for private: and public: except properties

organise includes via
<SFML path includes>
<std includes>
# solution files

seperate key sections in bodies with a blank line
ensure no empty lines at top of bottom of bodies
seperate individual definitions with 1 line
no big white space blocks at end of file (except from 1 line, is optional)

rename files that use assets as needed (if updating a lot of file names, that is)
no silly variable names ever
no silly comments when pushing. fine for local but remove before it reaches other's hands.

comments have a space before and after the // and first letter is Capitalised ( // Some comment)
if targeting a process, comment goes above and some gap must be visibly directly above the comment regardless of indentation. if targeting a decision or single declaration, comment goes beside.
