# Mission Squark
In this game you play as a bird which flies right and can be commanded to fly higher or lower.
Launch off the runway, crash down the enemy birds, avoid the level walls and land on the other landing pad to progress through levels.

One small feat I'd like to mention, is the accomplishment of developing this with absolutely no AI generated code.
The only point AI was used, was as a glorified search engine to look up the docs of SFML 3.0 (ensuring that actual webpages were fetched) and fact check certain knowledge terms.
Even then, I just looked at the docs myself most of the time, to get used to reading them.
This is part of my pursuit of becoming a properly self-dependent programmer which can rely on personal knowledge and passion-fired improvement without having to use AI to function at my best.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Enjoy and have fun!

## Backstory
Welcome! This project started out as a university piece, which required making a game in 8 and a bit weeks using only C++ and SFML 3.0.
I decided to work up something more original, inspired by the bird in Joust (1984), rather than learning to program a copy. Besides programming, I do like to make my own things that feel, look, sound, and seem cool.
I'm changing many elements over time due to some last-minute scrambling that came from the deadline of the project. You may still see lesser-than-ideal work that reflects this.

## Cool Things
- Tile-based level editing. Really easy to add levels and change existing ones, right from any IDE.
- Custom coordinate-based collision system. A first step for a simplified collision system that runs off of world position. Improvements to come.
- Player bird flight physics. Speed changes just like you would expect from how a real bird flies.
- RAM usage peaks at roughly 135MB. Can achieve even lower values.
- All original assets. All sound and graphics assets are home made. (Excluding the fonts)
- Parallax scenery. This was really fun to get working :)

## How to Run
To run the application, extract the ZIP to gather it's contents, then look for "MissionSquark.exe" amongst the files.
